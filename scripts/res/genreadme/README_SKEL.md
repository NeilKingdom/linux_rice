# How Can You Contribute?

<pre><code>
<h3>Collaborators</h3>

Those who are manually added as collaborators by the project maintainer
will be able to push changes to the repository without requiring
permission. Even so, it is advisable to use a Feature Branch Workflow
and create PRs rather than manually pushing the changes yourself.

<h3>Non-Collaborators</h3>

Those who would like to contribute (but whom are not project collaborators) may
still make suggestions in the form of Pull Requests (PRs). Below are the
instructions to do so:

1. The first step to create a PR is to fork the repository so that GitHub is aware that
you have duplicated it. To do this, click the drop down at the top of the GitHub page that
says "Fork" and click "Create a new fork". GitHub will create a forked repository under
your GitHub profile (you should not have to do this step again, however, you will need to
sync your forked repository regularly to keep it up to date).

2. Clone your forked repository to your local workspace.

3. The next step is to create a local feature branch. Run <strong>git checkout -b &#9001;branch_name&#9002;</strong>
to create a new branch called <em>branch_name</em>.

4. Make changes. Do <strong>git add .</strong> to stage all of the files that you've changed.

5. Make a commit e.g. <strong>git commit -m "commit message"</strong>.

6. Push the feature branch to your forked repo e.g. <strong>git push -u origin &#9001;branch_name&#9002;</strong>.

7. If successful, GitHub will immediately recognize the new branch. Now it is time to create the
PR. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab on GitHub under the upstream project's page. Click
"New pull request". On the RIGHT-HAND side click on the drop down that says "compare: main", and
select your feature branch. Click Create pull request. Enter a PR description of why you are
making a PR and a brief of what changes were made. Click submit to have it be forwarded to the
project maintainer for review.
