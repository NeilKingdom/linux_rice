   NOTE:
   fontconfig only applies to certain applications that rely on libraries such as
   pango or libXft. These typically include applications using GTK or Qt. Examples
   include, most notably, your browser, the libreoffice suite, dunst, or most other
   applications that use a GUI. Some applications still rely on the X11 protocol
   (e.g. Suckless programs) which is unrelated to this configuration file.

   When fc-match can't find an appropriate match based off font family or name, it
   resorts to other properties such as size, weight, etc. In my case, fc-match was
   picking super strange old-english fonts in the case that it couldn't find any
   appropriate matches. Since there is no real way to dynamically check within this
   config file whether the name/family produced no similarities, the best option I
   could come up with was to simply delete fonts that fc-match was matching on until
   it selected a default font that I could deal with.
